Lecture 2:
Creating our first grid
-in grid template, we define the height of our rows

Lecture 3:
Getting famiiar with Fr
-Fractional unit in css
-we cld also do better by not defining the rows one by one
-we use the repeat function and the number of rows we want
-we do the same for column

-if we wan the 3rd column with 300px not 150px
*********repeat(2, 150px) 300px;

-how do we make a column fill up the rest of remaining space
-to do this ,we use the Fractional unit

-if we want the columns to be of the same size, we use repeat(number of columns, 1fr)
-the 50% in column doesnot take into consideration the gap we put
fr also works on rows

Lecture 4:
Positioning Grid items
-how to position items anywhere we want on the grid
-the default layout is the source layout
-if we want to place the columns in differnet places
-how do we place grid item 1 into cell 5

Lecture 5:
Spanning grid items
-ie if you want the violet to span over the entire area
we give it the specification of number of grid wch is 4

-we can have multiple grid items in the same cell
